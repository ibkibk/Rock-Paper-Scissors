# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A repo for the game rock paper scissors. One of the first challenges completed independently at _nology, produced in Week 3. A game of rock paper scissors, played against the computer. You click on one of the buttons on your side and the computer will respond at the same time. A winner of that round will be determined and the score board will reflect that.

The game is written using html, css and javascript files.
